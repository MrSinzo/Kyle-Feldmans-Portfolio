  <p>I am a happily married man of 7 (Going on 8) years! I have 2 cats, an
    8 old female Calico, and a 9 week old male Short-hair kitten, named
    Zoey and Munchkin. I love to play table-top rpgs and wargames that
    include Miniature Figurines and lots of dice (E.G Pathfinder or
    Warhammer 40k). I am also a huge video game nerd, I love exploring
    lore and various fictional histories within whatever game I am
    currently playing. My Favorite video-game(s) of all time is the
    Fallout series.</p>
