      <p class="">This was a Group project I had the pleasure of being 
        involved in. The challenge presented a great learning oppurtunity for me 
        to work with fellow
        classmates, to imitate a real work enviroment with other
        collaborators. We were tasked to use a pair of API's, a new CSS
        framework, while pushing and pulling from Github. I personally faced
        the challenge of merge conflicts occasionally and it was an
        excellent time to learn and experiment with my collaborators and how
        the work flow truly functions! My primary tasks were to help lead
        the group to reach a MVP and apply a whole new framework I had
        previously no knowledge of until this project was assigned to us.
