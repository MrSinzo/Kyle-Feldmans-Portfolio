# Kyle Feldmans Portfolio

## What is it?
This is a simple webpage that will contain future project along with some basic "employer desired" details about myself (Kyle F.)

I built this Project to help give me ( or others that wish to mimic this code for their own portfolio) a great starting point to begin building a online resume.

## Why did I make this?

This solves the problem of needing to consistently email or fax my Resume to various places and companies, along with adding a reliable source for employers to get an understanding of my skills and potential employment through them or their company.


## How did I go about building this?
A small mix of HTML, semantic HTML and slightly advanced CSS were used and carefully constructed around a responsive layout so that all screen-sizes can optimally view this portfolio with ease.
