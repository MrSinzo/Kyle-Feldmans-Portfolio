// * A single `Navigation` component within the header that will be used

// THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
// WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
// THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them

// **Note**: Because this application doesnâ€™t include a back end 
// or connect to an API, the contact form doesn't need to save this
// information right now. You'll add back-end functionality
// in the next few weeks. In the meantime, consider including 
//your email address and phone number on the Contact page.
