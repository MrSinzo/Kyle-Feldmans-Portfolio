        Hello, my name is Kyle Feldman and thank you for taking
        the time to review my work to have possible employment based on my
        skills and talent that I can offer to you or your team! Below you will
        find a vareiety of projects I once found challenging or difficult to
        comprehend. I am a diligent and persistant hard-worker. I dont give up
        on things very easily, and dislike the feeling of "being defeated". I am
        exetremely productive, and dislike wasting anyone's time, especially my
        own or my employer's. I am paid to work and produce great content. Thats
        how it works in this world, no matter where you are form.
