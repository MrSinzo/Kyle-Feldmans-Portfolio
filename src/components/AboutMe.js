  Hello, my name is<strong>Kyle Feldman</strong>and thank you for taking
  the time to review my work to have possible employment based on my
  skills and talent that I can offer to you or your team! Below you will
  find a vareiety of projects I once found challenging or difficult to
  comprehend, and can now confidently say "I got this"!! I am a diligent
  and persistant hard-worker. I dont give up on things very easily, and
  dislike the feeling of "being defeated". I am exetremely productive,
  and dislike wasting anyone's time, especially my own or my employer's.
  I am paid to work and produce great content. Thats how it works in
  this world, no matter where you are form.
