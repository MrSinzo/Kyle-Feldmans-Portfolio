          Hello, my name is<strong>Kyle Feldman</strong>and thank you for taking
          the time to review my work to have possible employment based on my
          skills and talent that I can offer to you or your team! Below you will
          find a vareiety of projects I once found challenging or difficult to
          comprehend, and can now confidently say "I got this"!! I am a diligent
          and persistant hard-worker. I dont give up on things very easily, and
          dislike the feeling of "being defeated". I am exetremely productive,
          and dislike wasting anyone's time, especially my own or my employer's.
          I am paid to work and produce great content. Thats how it works in
          this world, no matter where you are form.
          <br />
          I am a happily married man of 7 (Going on 8) years! I have 2 cats, an
          8 old female Calico, and a 9 week old male Short-hair kitten, named
          Zoey and Munchkin. I love to play table-top rpgs and wargames that
          include Miniature Figurines and lots of dice (E.G Pathfinder or
          Warhammer 40k). I am also a huge video game nerd, I love exploring
          lore and various fictional histories within whatever game I am
          currently playing. My Favorite video-game(s) of all time is the
          Fallout series.

            <strong>Gif Me That Movie & TV Show Info! :</strong> This was a
            Group project I had the pleasure of being involved in. The challenge
            presented a great learning oppurtunity for me to work with fellow
            classmates, to imitate a real work enviroment with other
            collaborators. We were tasked to use a pair of API's, a new CSS
            framework, while pushing and pulling from Github. I personally faced
            the challenge of merge conflicts occasionally and it was an
            excellent time to learn and experiment with my collaborators and how
            the work flow truly functions! My primary tasks were to help lead
            the group to reach a MVP and apply a whole new framework I had
            previously no knowledge of until this project was assigned to us.
