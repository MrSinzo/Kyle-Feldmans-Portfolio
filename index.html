            Hello, my name is<strong>Kyle Feldman</strong>and thank you for 
          taking the time to review my work to have possible employment
          based on my skills and talent that I can offer to you.
          Below you will find a vareiety of projects I once found challenging
          or difficult to comprehend, and can now confidently say 
          "I got this"!! I am a diligent and persistant hard-worker. I dont give up on things very easily, and dislike the feeling of "being defeated".
          I am exetremely productive, and dislike wasting anyone's time, especially my own or my employer's. I am paid to work and produce great content. 
          Thats how it works in this world, no matter where you are form. 
            <br>
          I am a happily married man of 7 (Going on 8) years! I have 2 cats, 
          an 8 old female Calico, and a 6 week old 
          male Short-hair kitten, named Zoey and Munchkin. 
          I love to play table-top rpgs and wargames that include 
          Miniature Figurines and lots of dice 
          (E.G Pathfinder or Warhammer 40k). I am also a huge video 
          game nerd, I love exploring lore and 
          various fictional histories within whatever game I am 
          currently playing. My Favorite video-game of all time is the 
          Fallout series.
